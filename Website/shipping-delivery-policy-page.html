        <h1>Shipping and Delivery Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 31 Aug, 2024</p>
        <p>As a provider of software development services, Utkarsh Dalal primarily delivers digital products and services. This policy outlines our approach to the delivery of our services and any associated digital or physical goods.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Digital Deliveries</h2>
        <p>For digital products or services, delivery will typically be made via email, file transfer, or through access to a designated online platform. Delivery times will be specified in the project agreement.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Physical Deliveries</h2>
        <p>In the rare event that physical goods need to be shipped (e.g., hardware related to a project), shipping will be arranged on a case-by-case basis. Shipping costs and estimated delivery times will be communicated before the shipment is made.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Delivery Timeframes</h2>
        <p>Delivery timeframes for our services will be outlined in the project agreement. We strive to meet all agreed-upon deadlines but may occasionally experience delays due to unforeseen circumstances. In such cases, we will communicate with you promptly.</p>
        
        <h2>4. International Deliveries</h2>
        <p>For international clients, please note that you may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once the package reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you. We have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
