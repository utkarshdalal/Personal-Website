        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 31 Aug, 2024</p>
        <p>At Utkarsh Dalal, we are committed to providing high-quality software development services. However, we understand that there may be situations where a refund is necessary. This policy outlines our approach to refunds.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Service Cancellation</h2>
        <p>If you cancel a project before any work has begun, you will receive a full refund of any payments made. If work has already started, refunds will be prorated based on the amount of work completed.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Dissatisfaction with Services</h2>
        <p>If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately. We will work with you to resolve any issues. If a resolution cannot be reached, we may offer a partial or full refund at our discretion.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Refund Process</h2>
        <p>Refunds will be issued using the original method of payment. Please allow 5-10 business days for the refund to be processed.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Exceptions</h2>
        <p>No refunds will be given for completed projects where the deliverables meet the agreed-upon specifications.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about our refund policy, please contact us at dalal.utkarsh@gmail.com.</p>
